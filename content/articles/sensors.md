BlockDox proprietary and third-party sensors are used in the appropriate combination for the relevant location to gather footfall data and air quality data. These can include LIDAR (time of flight), WiFi sniffers, infrared thermal sensors, perimeter foot counters and indoor environmental air quality sensors. Our approach is for anonymous and passive counting, protecting privacy. However, we are hardware agnostic and if required we can integrate counting from other (more intrusive) methods such as CCTV. Our multi-sensor approach improves count reliability by minimising errors from data drift.
